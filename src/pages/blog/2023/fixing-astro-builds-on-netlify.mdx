I had a pretty big blog meltdown recently after I went to push a new post and the build failed with a mysterious “out of memory” error. I’ve had issues locally with AstroJS running a bit slow when building pages in development, so I can imagine it was probably doing heavy lifting during production builds. I was able to build locally - but I’m assuming the Netlify build servers didn’t have 32GB of RAM to kick around.

I thought I’d share the **simple** solution I found to **fix my AstroJS builds** and the **JavaScript heap allocation error.**

# The Error

If you’re here, you’ve probably encountered this error in your Netlify (or build server) logs:

# The Solution

After a bit of research and checking the AstroJS, I found [an automated post](https://discord.com/channels/830184174198718474/853350631389265940/1057944453916131440) merging [an Astro Docs commit](https://github.com/withastro/docs/commit/545b6462454cf7d501708045d46c0f58a252aa9b) that mentioned “netlify memory”. Taking a look at the commit, it seems that they added a Netlify configuration file (`netlify.toml`) with a custom build script. ]

The script essentially has an extra flag for increasing the amount of memory available (`--max_old_space_size=4096`). And it uses `pnpm` instead of `yarn` — which might improve performance as well.

Creating a `netlify.toml` in my site root and pushing that commit got everything working!

```toml
[build]
  command = "NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096 pnpm build"
```

# Hope that helps!

It’s always shocking to lose the ability to build your websites. I hope this info lets you publish again!
